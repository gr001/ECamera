# ECamera

This project was created as part of the GACR  14-28334S to enhance microscope picture of a neuronal cell. It applies a series of image filters + enhancers so we can get a better picture of the examining sample. The original picture is very flat with low contrast. After enhancing we can better target the microelectrode to the right place on the neuronal cell.
